Please use this template to apply to include a new framework on our list of [Production-grade React frameworks](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks). 

Our goal with the “Production-grade React frameworks” list is to set developers up for success with React, with frameworks that provide a great developer experience and make it easy to build a great user experience. While we understand that many frameworks may want to be featured, this page is not a place to advertise every possible React framework.

To be included, frameworks must meet the following criteria:

- **Easy onboarding experience**. The framework must be straightforward to install and configure to use with React. Frameworks may also support other view libraries as long as they meet the other requirements on this list.
- **Well-documented**. The framework must have documentation for common use-cases, troubleshooting, how to deploy apps, etc.
- **Ecosystem compatibility**. The framework must support using the full range of libraries and tools in the React ecosystem. 
- **Great developer experience**. The framework must allow developers to be productive, and support tools such as React Developer Tools and Fast Refresh.
- **Great user experience**. The framework must help developers create high quality user experiences by solving common use-cases. Specifically, the framework must provide built-in support for routing and data-fetching in a way that avoids client/server waterfalls by default.
- **Active Community**. The framework must have a sufficiently large/active community in order to provide help and support to users.
- **Compatible with our future vision for React**. React evolves over time, and frameworks that do not align with React’s direction risk isolating their users from the main React ecosystem over time. To be included on this page we must feel confident that the framework is setting its user up for success with React over time.
- **Self-hosting option**. The framework must support an option to self-host applications without losing access to the baseline features included on this list. 
- **Well maintained**. The framework must be actively maintained.
- **Free & open-source**.
